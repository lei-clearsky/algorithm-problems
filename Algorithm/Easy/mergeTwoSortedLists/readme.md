## Merge Two Sorted Lists

- Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
```
