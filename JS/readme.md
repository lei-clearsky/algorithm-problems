    - [Lexical Scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables and other resources of their parent scope](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript#lexical-scope).
    - [Whenever you see a function within another function, the inner function has access to the scope in the outer function, this is called Lexical Scope or Closure - also referred to as Static Scope.](https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/#lexical-scope)

    - [While in ES5 ‘this’ referred to the parent of the function, in ES6, arrow functions use lexical scoping — ‘this’ refers to it’s current surrounding scope and no further.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-es6-the-dope-way-part-ii-arrow-functions-and-the-this-keyword-381ac7a32881)
